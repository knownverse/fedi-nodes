What the fuck, can you actually do research before broadly making baseless claims against me?\n\nCunnyborea.top is a low-moderation instance managed by @nunnun, unrelated to cunnyborea.space. Despite being low-moderation, it does not tolerate spam or illegal content per U.S. laws. \n\nThe instance faced a significant spam attack in February, leading to widespread blocking. These issues have been resolved, and apologies are extended for any inconvenience caused. \n\nUsers are encouraged to self-moderate, as the instance does not guarantee moderation of offensive content. The instance is primarily funded out-of-pocket by the administrator, with donations welcome but not necessary.\n\nWe do not block many instances, and I do not consider Lolicon to be CP.\n",
